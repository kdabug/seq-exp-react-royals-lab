# Kings and Queens CRD

## Getting Started:
- Fork and clone this repo.
- Notice how I moved the back-end to the root directory.
- The front-end is located inside client.

## Deliverables:
- Complete the CRD functionality for front-end and back-end for Queens.
- A PR by 11pm tonight.

## Bonus:
- Complete the update functionality for front-end and back-end for Queens. We didn't get to this part in class due to timing, but it will be covered tomorrow.
